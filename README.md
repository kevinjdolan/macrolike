Macrolike Userscript

I wrote this back in 2009, when I was a Sophomore in Undergrad. I have not used it or updated it since then. I was an okay programmer back then, but I've learned a lot since then so no guarantees on quality here. I'm dumping this here because I am taking down my old blog and a lot of people would download this from there.

Most likely, this no longer works (due to the fact Facebook has changed since 2009).

Released under the WTFPL.

## Original release notes:

Are you tired of micro-managing your likes?  We all know that a well-placed like on Facebook can be hilarious. But clicking like over and over is so difficult! Now you can just like everything with one easy clickâ€¦

This is a GreaseMonkey script for clicking like on all stories on a page.  It works on any Facebook page.
